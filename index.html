    <h1>About What Happened</h1>
    <p>
      I messed up. I couldn’t handle things maturely and I know I acted childish.
      I need love, care, and attention like a child because my childhood wasn’t very comforting.
      I’m not in the best state of mind right now, and I get irritated and clumsy easily.
      I don’t fully understand what’s happening to me, but I do know one thing —
      please don’t leave me. I promise I will put in real effort and do better.
